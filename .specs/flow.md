# Flow — Component Spec

## Purpose

Flow renders a directed flow diagram: a horizontal sequence of steps (`flow-node`) joined by decorative connectors, with optional parallel branches (`flow-parallel`) and custom connector-attachment points (`flow-anchor`). Use it to visualize pipelines, workflows, and step-by-step processes inside a data view; unlike `data-table` it expresses ordered/branching relationships rather than tabular records. Steps are written as direct children of `flow`; a `flow-parallel` between two steps fans out from the previous step and fans back into the next, and a `flow-parallel` at the start/end fans only inward/outward (no dangling stubs). A node can be styled (the default box) or `unstyled` so its slot content defines the entire node — a dot, a tall card, a multi-row card — while connectors still attach correctly, optionally at `flow-anchor` points inside the node. Design source (rewritten to our conventions, never inherited as-is): the kumo "Flow" component group at https://kumo-ui.com/components/flow/. Scope boundary: large diagrams pan via a native `overflow: auto` scroll container on the root — free 2D drag-pan is intentionally out of scope (it would require an external positioning library forbidden by `.claude/rules/dependencies.md`). There is no Figma frame for this component; tokens are inferred from intent and recorded in the Theme gaps table.

## Usage

```vue
<script setup>
import Flow from '@aziontech/webkit/flow'
</script>

<template>
  <Flow align="center">
    <Flow.Node>Load balancer</Flow.Node>
    <Flow.Node unstyled>
      <div class="rounded-[var(--shape-card)] border border-[var(--border-default)] bg-[var(--bg-surface-overlay)]">
        <Flow.Anchor type="end">
          <div class="flex h-10 items-center px-[var(--spacing-sm)] text-label-md text-[var(--text-muted)]">
            my-worker
          </div>
        </Flow.Anchor>
        <Flow.Anchor type="start">
          <div class="m-[var(--spacing-xxs)] mt-0 rounded-[var(--shape-button)] border border-[var(--border-default)] bg-[var(--bg-surface)] px-[var(--spacing-sm)] py-[var(--spacing-xxs)] text-label-md text-[var(--text-default)]">
            Bindings
          </div>
        </Flow.Anchor>
      </div>
    </Flow.Node>
    <Flow.Parallel>
      <Flow.Node>DATABASE</Flow.Node>
      <Flow.Node>OTHER_SERVICE</Flow.Node>
    </Flow.Parallel>
  </Flow>
</template>
```

## Sub-components

- `flow-node/flow-node.vue` — A single step in the flow. Renders the default node box; `unstyled` drops the box so the `default` slot defines the node's appearance (a dot, a card, a tall node). `disabled` marks the step disabled, rendering adjacent connectors at reduced opacity (mirrored by `data-disabled`). Content via the `default` slot.
- `flow-anchor/flow-anchor.vue` — Marks a connector-attachment point inside a node and wraps the content that the connector should touch. `type="end"` is the incoming endpoint, `type="start"` the outgoing origin; omitted marks both. Content via the `default` slot.
- `flow-parallel/flow-parallel.vue` — Container whose direct `flow-node` children are laid out as parallel branches stacked vertically; the `flow` root draws the fan-out/fan-in junction connectors. `align` controls the horizontal alignment of the branches.

<!-- Resulting layout (composition):

  Public export is a single `./flow` entry (index.ts) that attaches the
  sub-components for dot-notation (`Flow.Node`, `Flow.Parallel`, `Flow.Anchor`);
  the same sub-components are also re-exported as named bindings from
  `@aziontech/webkit/flow`. -->

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Required | JSDoc |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `align` | `'start' \\| 'center'` | `'start'` | no | Vertical alignment of nodes within the diagram. |

## Events

| _none_ | — | — |

## Slots

| Slot | Scope | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `default` | — | Diagram content: `flow-node` and `flow-parallel`, in flow order. |

## States

- Visual states: `default`, `focus-visible`, `disabled`
- `data-disabled` mirrors the `disabled` prop on `flow-node`
- `data-styled` is present on `flow-node` unless `unstyled` (gates the default box utilities)
- `data-align` mirrors the `align` prop on `flow` and `flow-parallel`
- `data-flow-anchor` mirrors the `type` prop on `flow-anchor` (`start` / `end` / `both`)

## Motion & Animations

_none_

## Tokens

| Region | Token (DESIGN.md) |
|---|---|
| typography (node label) | `.text-label-md` |
| node surface | `var(--bg-surface-raised)` |
| node border | `var(--border-default)` |
| node text | `var(--text-default)` |
| connector stroke | `var(--border-default)` |
| disabled text | `var(--text-disabled)` |
| spacing | `var(--spacing-md)`, `var(--spacing-sm)`, `var(--spacing-xl)` |
| shape | `var(--shape-button)` |
| ring | `var(--ring-color)` |

## Theme gaps

| Figma variable | Temporary primitive | Follow-up |
|---|---|---|
| raised node surface (`bg-surface-raised`) | `var(--bg-surface-raised)` | TODO: confirm `--bg-surface-raised` is the canonical raised token |

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

- Visible focus: `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[var(--ring-color)] focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:ring-offset-[var(--bg-canvas)]`
- Keyboard map: `Tab` moves focus through focusable nodes in document order; no arrow-key roving (the diagram is a static list/group).
- ARIA: root `flow` is `role="list"`; each `flow-node` is `role="listitem"` with accessible text content; `flow-parallel` is `role="group"`; the connector SVG is decorative and carries `aria-hidden="true"`. A `flow-anchor` wraps meaningful node content and is therefore not hidden.
- Contrast ≥4.5:1 (text) / ≥3:1 (large + icons), including the disabled state.
- `motion-reduce:transition-none motion-reduce:transform-none` not required — the component is static (no motion).
- Touch target ≥40×40 px where a node is interactive.

## Stories (Storybook)

Composite stories are justified below because Flow is a composition component whose value is in how parts compose, not in a single `kind`/`size` axis:

- Default — a sequential flow of `flow-node` joined by connectors.
- Parallel — a `flow-parallel` fanning out and back in between two nodes (demonstrates the composition that a single `kind`/`size` axis cannot).
- Branches — leading and trailing `flow-parallel` (fan-in then fan-out), proving connectors route correctly at the edges of the sequence.
- CustomNodes — `unstyled` nodes whose slot content defines the appearance (a start dot, a tall node, a multi-row card with `flow-anchor` attachment points).
- Disabled — a `flow-node` with the `disabled` prop, showing the reduced-opacity connectors.

## Constraints — DO NOT

<!-- This block is injected VERBATIM into every sub-agent prompt.
     spec-validator rejects the spec if this block is missing or shorter than the template. -->

- Do not add props beyond the Props table above. If you need a prop that is not listed, emit `BLOCKED: missing prop <name>` and stop — do not invent.
- Do not add events beyond the Events table above. Same rule for slots and sub-components.
- Do not invent imports. Every `@aziontech/webkit/*` path must exist in `packages/webkit/package.json#exports`. Every relative import must resolve to a real file. Every npm package must be installed.
- Do not use HEX/RGB/HSL colors, Tailwind palette names (e.g. `bg-blue-500`), raw typography classes (e.g. `text-sm`), `any`, `@ts-ignore`, or `class` inside `defineProps`.
- Do not install or import positioning/animation libraries (`@floating-ui/*`, `popper.js`, `tippy.js`, `gsap`, `framer-motion`, `motion`, `@vueuse/motion`, `@formkit/auto-animate`, drag-drop runtimes, scroll virtualization libs). Use CSS + Vue primitives (`<Teleport>`, `<Transition>`). See `.claude/rules/dependencies.md`.
- Do not improvise animations. Every `animate-*` / `transition-*` class must come from `packages/theme/src/tokens/semantic/animations.js`; every motion-bearing class pairs with `motion-reduce:*` on the same class string; no component-local `@keyframes`.
- Do not create class presets in JavaScript (`const kindClasses = {...}`, `const sharedClasses = [...]`, `const sizeClasses = {...}`, `const rootClasses = computed(...)`). Variants live on `data-*` attributes consumed by Tailwind `data-[attr=value]:`. All utilities live inline on the root element's `class` attribute. No `<style>` block, no component-local `.css`/`.scss`. See `.claude/rules/styling.md`.
- Do not inherit artifacts as-is from another design system, Figma file, library, or pre-existing `CONTRACT.md` / `README.md`. Rewrite to our conventions. See `.claude/rules/migration.md`.
- Do not add Figma references to Storybook stories. No `parameters.design`, no `parameters.figma`, no Figma URLs in `docs.description.*`, no `@storybook/addon-designs` import. The Figma link is owned by `<name>.figma.ts` (Code Connect). See `.claude/docs/COMPONENT_REQUIREMENTS.md`.
- Do not use `parameters.actions.argTypesRegex` (deprecated in Storybook 8 and silently misroutes Vue 3 emits) or `parameters.actions.handles` (DOM-only). Declare every event explicitly in `argTypes` with a camelCase `on<Event>` key and `{ action: '<emitted-name>' }`. Do not use the legacy CSF2 `Name.args = {...}` form — always object-style CSF3.
- Do not add bespoke Storybook stories beyond Default + Types + Sizes + state stories (`Loading`, `Disabled`) for the props the component actually declares, unless the spec's "Stories (Storybook)" section explicitly justifies the addition. Do not split Types/Sizes into one-story-per-variant — the composite stories are the canonical pattern.
- Do not duplicate the `## Usage` block from the spec inside the Storybook story body. The block is injected once into `parameters.docs.description.component` by the storybook-write skill; copy it nowhere else.
- Do not edit `.claude/docs/DESIGN.md`, `.claude/docs/COMPONENT_REQUIREMENTS.md`, or `.claude/docs/PRIMEVUE_ABSTRACTION.md`.
- Do not edit the root `package.json` or `.github/workflows/*`.
- Do not change `structure` after `status: approved`. To change structure, bump `spec_version` and re-author the spec.
- Do not create files outside the paths declared by your task (the orchestrator tells you exactly which files to write).
- Do not run `git` commands, `pnpm install`, or any command that changes the lockfile.
- If anything in the spec is ambiguous or contradicts the rules, emit `BLOCKED: <one-sentence reason>` and write nothing.
